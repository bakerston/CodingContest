#### 143. Reorder List
#### Python
```swift
def reorderList(self, head: ListNode) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify head in-place instead.
        """
        slow = fast = head
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
        
        prev, curr = None, slow
        while curr:
            tmp = curr.next
            curr.next = prev
            prev = curr
            curr = tmp
        first, second = head, prev
        
        while second.next:
            curr = first.next
            first.next = second
            first = curr

#### CPP
```swift

        ListNode *prev = NULL, *curr = slow, *tmp;
        while (curr != NULL){

```swift
