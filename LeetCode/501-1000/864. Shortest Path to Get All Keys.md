## 864. Shortest Path to Get All Keys
## The key for this BFS question is that : we need to record the current key we have.
Imagine there are ```6``` keys in the map, and we start with ```(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)```, meaning currently we have 0 keys. 
  
  
## If we meet a key, pick it up and change key status.

Every time we meet a lower case ('a' for example) letter, we will change key status of ```key[0]```, and we will have ```(1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)``` if we visit this grid.

## If we meet a gate, check the current key status.
Imainge we meet gate ```4```, if we have already collected ```key 4```, meaning we can 'open' this gate and reach this grid in our next visit. Otherwise, this gate is currently unreachable for us.

## Finally, check if we have any final state with all keys collected.
For each state pop from queue, if the key status matches the final state, we calculate the minmum of length of the path.
